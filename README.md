# ai_navigator
we developed AI Navigator, a web application that allows users to interactively explore how pathfinding algorithms like A* and Dijkstra work in real-time specially in field of robotics.

🔧 Key Features:

Visualize how A* and Dijkstra work in real-time

Create custom grids with start, goal, and obstacles

Compare algorithm efficiency using path length statistics

User and admin login with access control

Admin dashboard to review saved paths and export data as CSV

Option to clear saved path data for the last 1 day, 1 week, or all data

💻 Tech Stack:
Python | Django | PostgreSQL | HTML/CSS
